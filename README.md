# TSMLA™ Technical Manual (Public Excerpt)

Welcome to the public-facing repository for the **TSMLA™ Technical Manual**, prepared by Fractal Labyrinth Systems LLC.

TSMLA™ (Tag-Weighted Self-Mirroring Logic Architecture) is a resonance-based recursive decision engine designed to classify, score, and mirror complex inputs using contradiction resolution, tag-weight scoring, Boolean logic, entropy modeling, and state coherence.

This repository contains a selected excerpt from the TSMLA™ Technical Manual, including the Table of Contents and architecture framing summary. The disclosed material reflects only a portion of the full system and is made public for signal resonance and external reference. All proprietary content, implementation logic, and backend diagrams are maintained under NDA.

> **Note:** The full manual includes additional sections and logic layers not represented in this excerpt. Access to the complete document is available upon request under NDA.
